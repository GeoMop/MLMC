# PLAN

## Current Goals

Goal 1: verify merge of `master` branch and prepare the branch for a pull request.
Goal 2: for a derived branch, implement a Dask-based sampler as an alternative to the PBS sampler.
Goal 3: implement specific simulations and quantities for estimation of Sobol indices.

## Current Repository State

- MLMC is a Python package for Multilevel Monte Carlo uncertainty
  quantification.
- Public package modules live under `mlmc/`.
- Main functional areas:
  - `sampler.py`, `level_simulation.py`, `sampling_pool.py`,
    `sampling_pool_pbs.py` - sample scheduling and execution backends.
  - `sample_storage.py`, `sample_storage_hdf.py`, `tool/hdf5.py` - sample
    persistence and HDF5 storage.
  - `estimator.py`, `moments.py`, `quantity/` - moment estimation, covariance,
    lazy quantities, and post-processing abstractions.
  - `random/` - correlated random field utilities.
  - `plot/` - plotting and diagnostics.
  - `sim/` - simulation interface and synthetic simulation implementation.
  - `tool/` - distributions, PBS/process helpers, Gmsh/Flow123d-related tools,
    and statistical utilities.
- `README.rst` describes package installation, PyPI distribution, Sphinx docs,
  dependencies, and `tox` as the contribution check.
- `docs/source/` contains Sphinx documentation and API pages.
- `test/` contains pytest tests plus integration-like fixtures for Flow/PBS and
  fracture examples.
- `tox.ini` targets Python 3.10 and 3.12 and runs tests excluding marker `pbs`.
- `test/pytest.ini` excludes marker `metacentrum`.
- Several reference planning/instruction files from other projects are present
  as untracked files and were used as style context:
  `AGENTS_HLAVO.md`, `AGENTS_ENDORSE.md`, `AGENTS_RAMPEC.md`,
  `PLAN_HLAVO.md`, `PLAN_ENDORSE.md`, `PLAN_RAMPEC.md`,
  and `python_coding.md`.

## Work Plan

### Goal 1: Verify Merge and Prepare PR

- Inspect current branch, merge state, staged/untracked files, and recent commits.
- Run targeted import/compile checks for files changed by the merge.
- Run the relevant pytest subset for changed behavior.
- Run `tox` if the merge touched shared behavior or if the branch is otherwise PR-ready.
- Review documentation and planning files for stale branch-specific notes.
- Record verification results and any remaining PR blockers in this plan.

## AGENT Log

- `2026-06-05`: Incorporated user answers into `AGENTS.md` and `PLAN.md`.
  MLMC is now documented as a production scientific library with 1.x
  compatibility, planned 2.x storage/interface changes, targeted pytest for
  routine debugging, and tox as the final PR-level check. Documentation only;
  no tests required.
- `2026-06-05`: Drafted initial MLMC `AGENTS.md` and `PLAN.md` from
  `README.rst`, `docs/source/index.rst`, `tox.ini`, `test/pytest.ini`,
  package layout, and copied reference project instruction files. Documentation
  only; no tests required.

## AGENT Questions And Remarks

- `2026-06-05`: Legacy/external fixture status is only partially classified.
  Treat `test/01_cond_field`, `test/02_conc`, and `test/fractures` as
  repository examples and legacy/integration fixtures, but do not assume they
  are part of routine tox/CI verification unless current tests prove that.
